#  Employee Salary Prediction Using Machine Learning Algorithms

This project predicts whether an employee's income exceeds $50K/year using machine learning techniques. The model is built using Python, Scikit-Learn, Pandas, and visualized with Seaborn and Matplotlib.



##  Problem Statement

The aim is to develop a predictive model that classifies whether an individual's income is `>50K` or `<=50K` based on demographic and professional attributes such as age, education, occupation, work hours, etc.

This is a classic **binary classification** problem and is widely used to demonstrate data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation techniques.


##  Architecture Overview

The solution is structured into the following stages:

1. **Data Loading**  
   Load dataset using `pandas`.

2. **Preprocessing**  
   - Label encode the target variable (`income`).
   - One-hot encode categorical features.
   - Scale numerical features using `StandardScaler`.
   - Use `ColumnTransformer` to process features in parallel.

3. **Modeling**  
   Use a `RandomForestClassifier` inside a `Pipeline` for automation and scalability.

4. **Evaluation**  
   - `Accuracy Score`  
   - `Classification Report`  
   - `Confusion Matrix` (with heatmap visualization)

5. **Visualization**  
   Confusion matrix is plotted using `seaborn.heatmap`.


##  Tech Stack

##  How to Run the Project

1. **Install dependencies**
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
   
2.**Run the Python script**

  python salary_prediction.py
  
3.**Optional Streamlit App**

pip install streamlit
streamlit run app.py

**Model Performance**
Model: RandomForestClassifier with 200 trees

Accuracy: ~85â€“90% (depending on random state)

Deployment Ready: Yes (Streamlit or Flask)

**Evaluation Metrics**

Accuracy Score
